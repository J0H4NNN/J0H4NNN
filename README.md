Hi, I’m @J0H4NNN
I'am generally interested in informatics and Robotics as well as engeneering and I'am also experiencing at all of them.
Right now I have a lot of projects in web-design and other sofware applications, but my latest project is a nearly 100% DIY RC-Race-Boat whose
433mhz Radio Control I programmed myself.
You'll see the development of this soon here.
